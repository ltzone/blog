**SJTU-Go** is a system which collects the real-time shared vehicles information on SJTU campus and provides navigating services for SJTUers. The backend of the system is developed in **Java** and deployed online. The frontend is presented in **WeChat miniprogram**. Some functions of this system currently may not work for lack of backend server support. This work was completed as a 6-member group project in 2020 Spring, and has won the **second prize** of 2020 CCF NCSC Software Service Innovation Competition.
