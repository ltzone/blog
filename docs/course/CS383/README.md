By Kenny Q. Zhu, SJTU

A small number of concepts underline the hundreds of programming languages that have been designed and implemented. This course introduces the concepts that serve as a basis for programming languages. It aims to provide the students with a basic understanding and appreciation of the various essential programming language constructs, programming paradigms, evaluation criteria and language implementation issues. The course covers concepts from functional, imperative, object-oriented, logic programming and optionally scripting languages. These concepts are demonstrated by incrementally adding more features to a simple functional language called Lambda Calculus to eventually arrive at a full-fledged, user-friendly general purpose programming language. At the end of the course, a number of modern programming languages from various paradigms are presented as examples.
