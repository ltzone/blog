## Classification of network by Physical Media

physical media is what lies between a transmitter and receiver pair
- guided media: solid media, 
  - twisted pair (双绞线), 
    > reduces electrical interference
    > 
    > adequate performance and low cost
  - fiber optics (光纤), 
    > wide bandwidth 10's THz
  - coaxial cable (同轴电缆), ...
    > high performance and excellent noise immunity
    > 
    > bandwidth better than twisted pair
    > 
    > but being replaced by fiber
- unguided media: signal propagates freely, atmosphere, outer space (through satellietes)

::: tip Bandwidth

e.g. UTP CAT3 has 16MHz bandwidth, 10Mbps 
- data rate: bit per second
- bandwidth: measured by frequency
> Not same, but related
