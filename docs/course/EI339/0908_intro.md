## What is intelligence

1. Learning
2. Reasoning
   - Deductive 演绎: maths & logic -> axioms & rules
   - Inductive 归纳: science & data -> models -> revised models
3. Problem Solving
   - systematic search through a range of actions
   - special purpose(e.g. in games) & general purpose(e.g. alphago (incomplete solution))
4. Perception
   - scanned by means of various sensory organs
5. Language
   - a system of signs having meaning by convention (e.g. inference of FOL)

## What is AI

The general views of AI fall into 4 categories as follows:

- Perspective
  - Action 外延
  - Thought 内涵
- Objective
  - Humanly
  - Rationally

The course advocates **acting rationally** (**Computational Rationality**)

### Rational Decisions
- rationality only concerns what decisions are made (not the thought process behind him)
- goals are expressed in terms of the **utility** of outcomes
  - but the definition of **utility** can be subjective or objective
> Being rational means maximizing your **expected utility**

## What about brain
- brains are good at making rational decisions, but not perfect
- not as modular as software, hard to reverse engineer
- brains are to intelligence as wings are to flight

## History: Main Figures

- John McCarthy  (symbolic)
  - lisp
  - inference, search algorithms
  - AI Programming Languages
- Marvin Minsky - neural networks, telepresence (subsymbolic)
  - bayesian learning
  - deep learning
  - connectionism
  - LDA,SVM,HMM,PMF
