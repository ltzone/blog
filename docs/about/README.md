# Litao Zhou (Tony)

I am a junior undergraduate student studying Computer Science at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/) (SJTU). I expect to graduate in June, 2022.

My research interest is **Formal Verification** and **Programming Language**. I also enjoy developing software and programming.



## Working Experience

(September 2020 ~ Januray 2021) **Intel Asia Pacific R&D Center**, Visual and Parallel Computing Group – **Intern of Software Engineering**

## Research Projects

- **Classical Real** (2019 Spring, instructed by [Qinxiang Cao](http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/people/members/faculty/qinxiang-cao.html)): verify the correctness of the Theory of Real Number Construction (Cantor’s Construction) in [Coq](https://coq.inria.fr/). [Source Code](https://github.com/QinxiangCao/ClassicalReal)

- **Graph Formal** (2019 Fall ~ Now, instructed by [Qinxiang Cao](http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/people/members/faculty/qinxiang-cao.html)): explore efficient (maybe automated) ways to verify the correctness of graph algorithms(e.g. DFS, Tarjan, 2-SAT) using VST (a formal framework for verifying correctness of C programs).

- **Functional Programming** (2020 Summer ~ Now, instructed by [Yuting Wang](http://jhc.sjtu.edu.cn/~yutingwang/)):
  - Used OCaml, a functional programming language, to implement some instances of interpreters, compilers and virtual machine models of *lambda calculus*.
  - Using [Teyjus](http://teyjus.cs.umn.edu/), a high-order logic programming language, to implement a compiler with only a few codes that can compile functional programs (working).



## Course Projects

### SJTU-Go

**SJTU-Go** is a system which collects the real-time shared vehicles information on SJTU campus and provides navigating services for SJTUers. The backend of the system is developed in **Java** and deployed online. The frontend is presented in **WeChat miniprogram**. Some functions of this system currently may not work for lack of backend server support. This work was completed as a 6-member group project in 2020 Spring, and has won the **second prize** of 2020 CCF NCSC Software Service Innovation Competition.

### E-products Search

**Lab for EE208** is an integrated search engine for electronic products information crawled from Jingdong and Suning (two famous e-Commerce sites in China), using **Lucene** as the search engine, **web.py** as the frontend. Some image retrival techniques are also applied such as **SIFT and LSH** (local sensitive hash). The project was completed with Shaoheng Fang, Shiwen Dong, Hongbo Yang in 2019 Fall.

### Academic Search

**Smart Boy Search** (aka. Lab for EE101) is a website which allows users to search for papers and learn more about the details through the webpage and visualized charts. The website is based on **MySQL** database, **Solr** search engine and **PHP**. **Echarts** and **Gephi** are applied in visualization. The project was completed with Shaoheng Fang, Shiwen Dong, Hongbo Yang in 2019 Spring.
